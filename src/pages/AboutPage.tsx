              <h2>Our Mission</h2>
              <p>
                At Jobs-Here, we're on a mission to transform how job seekers and employers connect. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technology, we create perfect matches that benefit both parties, saving time and reducing hiring friction.
              </p>

              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Founded in 2023, Jobs-Here emerged from a simple observation: traditional job searching and recruitment processes are inefficient and often frustrating. Our founders, experienced in both HR and AI technology, set out to build a platform that understands the nuanced needs of both job seekers and employers.
              </p>

              <h2>How We're Different</h2>
              <p>
                Unlike traditional job boards or recruitment agencies, Jobs-Here uses sophisticated AI algorithms to analyze not just skills and experience, but also working styles, values, and career aspirations. This holistic approach ensures better matches that lead to higher job satisfaction and employee retention.
